# Ajio Infinite Scrolling Automation

This project automates the infinite scrolling behavior on Ajio's website using Python and Selenium. It demonstrates how to mimic human-like scrolling on a webpage that loads content dynamically as the user scrolls down. This project does not perform any data extraction but focuses on the automation of scrolling.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

Websites with infinite scrolling load additional content dynamically as you scroll down the page. This project uses **Selenium** to control Chrome as a bot to simulate scrolling, ensuring all dynamically loaded content is rendered on the page. The project can be expanded for further tasks such as scraping the loaded content.

## 🚀 Features

- Automates infinite scrolling behavior on Ajio's website.
- Uses Selenium and Python for browser automation.
- Demonstrates how to control scrolling to load dynamic content on a webpage.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Selenium**: Tool for browser automation.
- **ChromeDriver**: To automate interactions with the Chrome browser.
